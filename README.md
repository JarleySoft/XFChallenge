# Xamarin Forms Challenge

Xamarin Forms can now target so many platforms, we probably can't get it running on all of them in a single session -- but we're going to try!

For this session, we will create a simple app in Xamarin Forms using the standard iOS, Android and Windows UWP. Then we will see what it takes to add support for as many other platforms as possible. Windows WPF, macOS, Tizen? Xbox?, Web?
